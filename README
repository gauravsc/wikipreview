A jQuery plugin to show preview of selected text in Wikipedia inside an iframe on the page. 

Below is an example of how it needs to be called

//To display the iframe with the preview
$().wpreview({"left":"200px","top":"20px", "text":"apple", "func":"wikipreview"});

//To hide the iframe of preview
$().wpreview({"left":"200px","top":"20px", "text":"apple", "func":"clearpreview"});

There is a demo file called demo.html which shows the use of this plugin, enjoy :-)
